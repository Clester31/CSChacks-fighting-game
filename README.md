# CSC Hacks - Fighting Game (name not final)

## Project Description
For our CSC hacks project, we all wanted to create a game that was simple to understand and could easily be enjoyed. We decided on making an arcade style fighting game in Unity. We wanted to create this project to not only challenge ourselves by doing something completely new to us, but to also create something from the ground-up as a team and to gain valuable experience. In order to meet our goals and expectations, we will need to relearn and touch up on C# and Unity. Most of our team memebers have had past experience with unity however, so its mostly a process of relearning key components of the software. With only about a month of development until the deadline, we expect to run into some challenges regarding the implementation of all our ideas as some of them may not make it into the final build, but we are confident that we can still create an enjoyable user experience in our final product.
